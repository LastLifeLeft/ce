# Serialize
Object serialization is a process of converting objects into pure data, which then can be stored onto the disk, sent over the network etc. Deserialization is then process of taking the data and converting it back into the object. This is a very common task for games, whether it is for multiplayer or a save system. In this section you can find how to define serializable properties per object and how to then serialize them to data and then deserialize the data back into objects.
