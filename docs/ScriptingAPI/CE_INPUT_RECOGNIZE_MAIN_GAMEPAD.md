# CE_INPUT_RECOGNIZE_MAIN_GAMEPAD
`macro`
## Description
`bool` If set to `true`, then the system tries to automatically
 recognize the main gamepad upon game start. It is suggested to leave this at
 `false` and set it manually using the [CE_EV_GAMEPAD_CONNECTED](./CE_EV_GAMEPAD_CONNECTED.html)
 event for example.
