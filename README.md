# About
CE is a collection of open-source GML libraries for GameMaker Studio 2. Its target is to provide you with a strong codebase so you can focus on coding your games instead of their technical backgrounds.

# Documentation and help
Documentation for the latest release of CE is available online at https://kraifpatrik.com/docs/ce. If you need any additional help, you can join its dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QjyxmHP) or its [forum thread](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/62585/).

## Building documentation
If you need a documentation for a previous release or you just want to have the documentation available offline, you can build it using [GMDoc](https://github.com/kraifpatrik/gmdoc).

**Example:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/slagtand-org/ce.git
cd .\ce
git checkout 2.0.0
gmdoc build
```
