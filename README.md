# About
CE is a collection of open-source GML libraries for GameMaker Studio 2. Its target is to provide you with a strong codebase so you can focus on coding your games instead of their technical backgrounds.

Previously it was released only as a single extension [CE Core](https://github.com/kraifpatrik/ce-core), which suffered from dependency hell when trying to include only a specific library. This was the main motivation to split the extension into multiple repositories, each representing a library, which can be then included into you projects using [Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst), the open-source package manager for GameMaker Studio 2.

# Installation
Use [Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst) to add CE into your project.

*Adding the entire collection - all libraries listed below:*
```sh
catalyst require slagtand-org/ce@<release>  # e.g. slagtand-org/ce@1.4.0
```

*Adding a specific library:*
```sh
catalyst require slagtand-org/<library>  # e.g. slagtand-org/ce-class
```

When including a single library, Catalyst automatically resolves its dependencies and adds them to your project as well.

# Documentation and help
Documentation for the latest release of CE is available online at https://kraifpatrik.com/docs/ce. If you need any additional help, you can join its dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QjyxmHP) or its [forum thread](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/62585/).

## Building documentation
If you need a documentation for a previous release or you just want to have the documentation available offline, you can build it using [GMDoc](https://github.com/kraifpatrik/gmdoc).

**Example:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/slagtand-org/ce.git
cd .\ce
git checkout 1.4.0
catalyst install # Required to install the libraries included in the release!
gmdoc build
```
