# About
CE is a collection of open-source GML libraries for GameMaker Studio 2 developed by an experienced programmer ([tools and graphics programmer of BBP](https://blueburn.cz/index.php?menu=bbp), [TyuTyu NyuNyu: The Forest Ninja](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueburn.ForestNinja), [PushEd](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/PushEd), [BlueBurn AssetCreator](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/60628/), [Xpanda](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/Xpanda), [YYC Overwrite](https://github.com/kraifpatrik/yyc-overwrite), [Optimizing code for YYC](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/62937/)
, [Custom C++ in YYC without DLLs](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/63045)). Its target is to provide you with a strong codebase so you can focus on coding your games instead of their technical backgrounds.

Previously it was released as a single extension called [CE Core](https://github.com/kraifpatrik/ce-core), which suffered from dependency hell when trying to include only a specific library. This was the main motivation to split the extension into multiple repositories, each representing a library, which can be then included into you projects using [Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst), the open-source package manager for GameMaker Studio 2.

# Installation
Use [Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst) to add CE into your project.

*Adding the entire collection - all libraries listed below:*
```sh
catalyst require kraifpatrik/ce@<release>  # e.g. kraifpatrik/ce@1.3.1
```

*Adding a specific library:*
```sh
catalyst require kraifpatrik/<library>  # e.g. kraifpatrik/ce-class
```

When including a single library, Catalyst automatically resolves its dependencies and adds them to your project as well.
