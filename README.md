# About
CE is a collection of open-source GML libraries for GameMaker Studio 2. Its target is to provide you with a strong codebase so you can focus on coding your games instead of their technical backgrounds.

Previously it was released as a single extension called [CE Core](https://github.com/kraifpatrik/ce-core), which suffered from dependency hell when trying to include only a specific library. This was the main motivation to split the extension into multiple repositories, each representing a library, which can be then included into you projects using [Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst), the open-source package manager for GameMaker Studio 2.

# Installation
Use [Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst) to add CE into your project.

*Adding the entire collection - all libraries listed below:*
```sh
catalyst require kraifpatrik/ce@<release>  # e.g. kraifpatrik/ce@1.3.1
```

*Adding a specific library:*
```sh
catalyst require kraifpatrik/<library>  # e.g. kraifpatrik/ce-class
```

When including a single library, Catalyst automatically resolves its dependencies and adds them to your project as well.

# Documentation and help
Documentation for the latest release of CE is available online at https://kraifpatrik.com/docs/ce. If you need any additional help or you would just like to chat with other users of CE, you can join its dedicated Discord server: https://discord.gg/nt5hZWt.

## Building documentation

**Example:**
* `git clone https://github.com/kraifpatrik/ce.git`
* `cd .\ce`
* `git checkout 1.3.1`
