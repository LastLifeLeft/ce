# Configuration
For proper functionality of the custom event system, CE needs to reserve one of the *User Event*s. The number of the User Event can configured through the [CE_EV_BIND_CUSTOM](./CE_EV_BIND_CUSTOM.html) macro, which can be found in the [ce_event_config](./ce_event_config.html) script. Triggering custom events triggers the specified User Event from where you can access the events' data, react to it and optionally return a value.
