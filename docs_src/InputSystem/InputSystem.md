# Input system
An input system is a crucial part of every game, as every game requires some kind of interaction with the player, whether its through a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. CE contains an input system which enables you to easily define, modify, save & load input schemes by assigning mouse + keyboard or gamepad controls to actions and then check whether any key bound to an action is held down/pressed/released. In this section you can find an overview which should help you get started with the input system.
