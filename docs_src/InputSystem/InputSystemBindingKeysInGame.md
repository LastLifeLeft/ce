# Binding keys in-game
The input system comes with a very important feature, which is binding keys in-game and so allow the players to create their own input schemes and play more comfortably. To start binding keys to an action, use the function [ce_input_bind](./ce_input_bind.html). If you would like to first clear all binding of the action, you can do so using function [ce_input_scheme_clear_bindings](./ce_input_scheme_clear_bindings.html).

Maximum number of bound keys can be configured with the [CE_INPUT_MAX_BINDINGS](./CE_INPUT_MAX_BINDINGS.html) macro, which is defined in the script [ce_input_config](./ce_input_config.html). This script also defines macro [CE_INPUT_BINDING_TIMEFRAME](./CE_INPUT_BINDING_TIMEFRAME.html), which tells how much time (in milliseconds) the player has to bind the keys. If they do not press any key during that time frame, then the bindings stay the same. See the contents of the script for more configuration options.

You can use functions [ce_input_get_binding_action](./ce_input_get_binding_action.html), [ce_input_get_binding_scheme](./ce_input_get_binding_scheme.html) and [ce_input_get_binding_controller](./ce_input_get_binding_controller.html) to check to which action and scheme is the player binding and which controller are they using. To check how much time is left for binding the keys, use function [ce_input_get_binding_countdown](./ce_input_get_binding_countdown.html)
[ce_input_get_binding_countdown_l](./ce_input_get_binding_countdown_l.html). The former returns number of milliseconds and the latter a value in range 0..1, where 0 means there is no time left and 1 means that the binding has just started.
